    "# 02 — Catalyst Optimizer & Query Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics covered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Catalyst optimizer phases** — 4-phase pipeline: parsing → analysis → logical optimization (rule-based) → physical planning (cost-based).\n",
    "2. **Predicate pushdown** — Catalyst pushes filters to data source level (Parquet row-group filtering, JDBC WHERE delegation), reducing I/O.\n",
    "3. **Reading execution plans (`.explain()`)** — logical/physical/optimized plans, identifying scans, exchanges (shuffles), sorts, broadcasts, codegen blocks.\n",
    "4. **Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)** — CBO uses table/column statistics (`ANALYZE TABLE`) for join order/strategy decisions vs. RBO's fixed rules."

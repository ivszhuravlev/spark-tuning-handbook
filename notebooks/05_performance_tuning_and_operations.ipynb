    "# 07 — Performance Tuning & Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics covered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)** — dynamic partition coalescing, join strategy switching at runtime, skew join handling. When AQE helps vs. when manual tuning is still needed.\n",
    "2. **Broadcast variables and accumulators** — broadcast = read-only data to all executors; accumulators = write-only counters back to driver. Gotchas: double-count on retries, memory consumption, stale broadcasts need `unpersist()`.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic resource allocation** — auto-scaling executors, external shuffle service requirement, `spark.dynamicAllocation.*` configs.\n",
    "4. **Speculative execution** — straggler mitigation: re-launch slow tasks on other nodes. Trade-off: extra resources vs. tail-latency reduction.\n",
    "5. **Fault tolerance and task/stage failures** — lineage-based recomputation, stage retry, checkpointing (truncate lineage), DAG's role in recovery."
